  Check file info, from files.xxx.lst to check.xxx.lst

z_Collect
  Collect file info from daily check list and generate obsed list

z_HeaderInfo
  Extract info from fits file header, use this to adapt to different telescope

z_Planner
  Make plan of each day

  ;1. Load all blocks and fields
  ;2. Load finished fields
  ;3. Remove finished fields, get new blocks
  ;4. Calc JD and sidereal time of midnight, and moon position
  ;5. Remove blocks with moon angle lt 90
  ;6. Choose a best block
  ;   Algorithm for choose best
  ;     Get current JD and sidereal time
  ;     Calc azi and alt of all blocks, remove alt gt 80
  ;     Select min of dec * 0.5 + (90-alt)*0.5
  ;7. Make a script for the block, and calculate time cost
  ;8. Get new "current" time, if before dawn, goto 4
  ;9. Ending work
